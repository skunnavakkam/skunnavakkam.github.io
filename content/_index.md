Hi! I'm *Sudarsh*.

I'm a freshman at Caltech. I also poke language models at METR. In the past, I've also worked with startups like Haize, and on AI research. Before this, I got good at chess and did Physics research.

Personally, I'm vegan and write for myself a lot.

I'm incredibly interested in Neurobiology & Theory of Cognition, most Physics research, manufacturing, and metrology. I also like to cook, lift and touch grass. If you want to learn more about me, check out my [about page](/about)

I want to meet new people. Please free to reach out, especially if you are extremely passionate about some :) I love talking to people who love things, and I would almost certainly be willing to help if you wanted my help, or just wanted to tell someone else about your work. [tips on reaching out to me and giving me feedback](/about/#reaching-out-to-me)

You can leave me feedback (<u>strongly encouraged!!</u>) *[here](https://www.admonymous.co/sudarshk)*. You should have a very low bar for this :)

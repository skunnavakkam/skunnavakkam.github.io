Hi! I'm *Sudarsh*.

I'm a freshman at Caltech! I currently poke language models at METR as a contractor, work in the [ShapiroLab@Caltech](https://shapirolab.caltech.edu/), and also work on collusion among language models for my SPAR Spring 2024 project! In the past, I worked with startups, did Nanophotonics research at UC Irvine, and got good at Chess. 

I love Physics, Math, and Biology. If you want to learn more about me, check out my [about page](/about)

I want to meet new people. Please free to reach out! I love talking to people who love things, and I would almost certainly be willing to help if you wanted my help, or just wanted to tell someone else about your work. [tips on reaching out to me and giving me feedback](/about/#reaching-out-to-me)

You can leave me feedback (<u>strongly encouraged!!</u>) *[here](https://sudarsh.com/feedback)*. You should have a very low bar for this :) Anything, and I mean anything, helps

Hi! I'm *Sudarsh*.

I'm an incoming freshman at Caltech. I also poke language models at METR. Before this, I got good at chess and did Physics research.

I'm incredibly interested in Neurobiology & Theory of Cognition, most Physics research, manufacturing, and metrology. I also like to cook, lift and touch grass. If you want to learn more about me, check out my [about page](/about)

I want to meet new people. Please free to reach out! I also like writing simulators for Physics / Physics adjacent topics / Neuroscience. Please let me know if there's something cool you would like a simulator for!

You can leave me feedback (<u>strongly encouraged!!</u>) *[here](https://www.admonymous.co/sudarshk)*

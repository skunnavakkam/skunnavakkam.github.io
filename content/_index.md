I'm a freshman at Caltech! I currently poke language models at [METR](https://metr.org/) as a contractor, work in the [ShapiroLab@Caltech](https://shapirolab.caltech.edu/), and also work on collusion among language models for my SPAR Spring 2024 project! In the past, I worked with startups, did Nanophotonics research at [UC Irvine](https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/lee-lab/home), and got good at Chess.

You can also meet my friends [here](/friends.html) :D

I want to meet new people. Please free to reach out! I love talking to people who love things, and I would almost certainly be willing to help if you wanted my help, or just wanted to tell someone else about your work. [tips on reaching out to me and giving me feedback](/about/#reaching-out-to-me)

You can leave me feedback (<u>strongly encouraged!!</u>) *[here](https://sudarsh.com/feedback)*. You should have a very low bar for this :) Anything, and I mean anything, helps

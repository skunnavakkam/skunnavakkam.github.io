I'm a freshman at Caltech. I spend most of my doing AI Safety work, physics, math, and biology. I care a lot about trying to make the world a happier and more abundant place, and I try to do this by doing good science. 

I value kindness, honesty, hard work, and being real and genuine. If you'd like to learn more about me and the things I do, see my [about page](/about). I love meeting new people, please reach out if you'd like!

I love my friends. You should see some of their websites [here](/friends.html)

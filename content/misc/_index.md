## bookshelf
My favorite way to read to learn is to read textbooks. As a result, textbooks are generally over-represented in my catalog (?). I would love for there to be a TCS course or Information Theory course in 3b1b fashion (and I think that this is the *ideal* format to learn), but there sadly isn't.

#### Textbooks
- **Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science** by Boaz Barak at Harvard
- **An Introduction to Gödel’s Theorems** by Peter Smith
- Halliday, Resnick, Krane

#### Non-Fiction
- **The Experience Machine** by Andy Clark

#### Fiction-y
- **What if?** and **Thing Explainer** by Randall Munroe
- **Three Body Problem** trilogy
-

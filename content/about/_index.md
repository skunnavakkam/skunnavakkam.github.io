Hi! I'm Sudarsh. I'm an incoming freshman at Caltech, where I'm likely going to major in Computational Neuroscience, Physics, Electrical Engineering, or Applied Math. 

You can reach me at kvsudarsh786 at gmail.com

You can also read what I've been reading at [curius](https://curius.app/sudarsh-k)

## What I want to do
I want to do cool, hard things. Some of the cool, hard things that I'm interested in right now are
- Neuromorphic computing
- Precise, macro-scale manufacturing
- Better interpretability work on animal brains
- Stateful AI models

## Things you can talk to me about!

### Cognition
- How do language models update their world model based on context?
	- We can provide a language model function pairs `(x, y)` of some simple function. It should then learn to

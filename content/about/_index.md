I'm Sudarsh. I am currently a high school and an incoming student at the California Institute of Technology likely majoring in Physics and Computational Math. I work as a model interactor with [METR](https://metr.org). I am also an intern at the Lee Nano-optics Lab at the University of California, Irvine, where I investigate ENZ materials. 

If you would for some reason help out with my work, please consider donating OpenAI, TogetherAI, Anthropic, and/or general GPU credits. 

If you have any questions for me, please address them at kvsudarsh786 at gmail dot com

Hi! I'm Sudarsh. I study Physics at Caltech. I spend most of my time doing AI Safety work, physics, math, and biology. I think AI safety and BCIs are really cool fields, and I hope to play a part in their future.

Some things I've been affiliated with:
- Poking models at [METR](https://metr.org/)
- Working on ultrasound imaging at the [ShapiroLab](https://shapirolab.caltech.edu/)
- Researching language model collusion in [SPAR](https://sparai.org/)
- Nanophotonics research at [UCI](https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/lee-lab/home)
- Attended ratcamps, ARENA 6.0, and other things
- Got good at Chess

You can contact me at

or anywhere else you can find me. Please reach out if you'd like! It's always refreshing to meet new people.

I like to build, hike, go to concerts, listen to music, and appreciate art. I'm a big fan of programmatic art, and I'm trying to incorporate more of it onto this site.

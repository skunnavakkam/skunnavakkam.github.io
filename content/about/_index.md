Hi! I'm Sudarsh. I'm an incoming freshman at Caltech, where I'm likely going to major in Computational Neuroscience, Physics, or Electrical Engineering. 


## In brief
I want to do cool, hard things. Some of the cool, hard things that I'm interested in right now are
- Neuromorphic computing
- Precise, macro-scale manufacturing
- Better interpretability work on animal brains
- Stateful AI models

At a broad level, most of my interests could boil down to the computational sciences, since I see immense potential for computational efficiencies to improve how we do science. 

## In not brief (and other things I'm interested in)

I'm Sudarsh. I am currently a high school and an incoming student at the California Institute of Technology likely majoring in Physics and Computational Math. I work as a model interactor with (METR)[https://metr.org]. I am also an intern at the Lee Nano-optics Lab at the University of California, Irvine, where I investigate ENZ materials. 

I am working on a large project in computational science. You may hear more about this in the future.

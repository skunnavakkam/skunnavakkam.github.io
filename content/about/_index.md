I'm Sudarsh. I currently
- do Nanophotonics Researcher at UC Irvine
- interact with Large Langauge Model at [METR](https://metr.org)
- am completing high school

I currently focus on Computational Physics. Specifically, I am most interested in using ML techniques for Physics design. Some of the things I want to explore are:
- Automated Proofs
- Inverse Design
- Grounded LLM Agents for Physics Research

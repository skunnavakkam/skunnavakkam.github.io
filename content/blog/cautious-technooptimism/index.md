The next few years are going to be incredibly transformative. There are many technologies
nearly on the cusp now, which will push over the edge in the next decade or two. Among these 
are not only non-human intelligences, but also strides in medicine, lab automation, and
other similar fields.

We probably see large economic effects as these technologies become more and more prevalent.
Recently, the stock market lost a good chunk of capitalization due to the release of
Claude Cowork. It seems not unreasonable that we see large amounts of job displacement
due to this type of automation, and it is unclear to me whether these technologies that
will emerge in the next few years will be normal - i.e, whether they will produce
more jobs as a result of their existence.

I think the most worrying situation is that these technologies are not normal -- they 
do lead to job loss and permanent economic displacement. This family of futures, the
ones where [humans need not apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU), 
seem like a real possibility, and to me can also be wildly good or bad.

There's a good deal of effort in preventing wildly bad futures, and most of the companies
building towards these transformative technologies often have a team dedicated to 
thinking about how to prevent bad futures; be those biosafety teams or alignment teams.
I'm not entirely convinced that the extremely bad futures -- ones where humans endure
a great deal of suffering, or extinction -- are guaranteed to not happen, which is
why I qualify my optimism as caution. Being complacent here is really bad!

I think a lot of the notkilleveryone futures are also really bad -- the consolidation
of power in selfish groups results in massive disenfranchisement of the general public.
This worries me a lot, in fact -- one of the wants I have for the future is that we are
able to lift Billions and Billions of people out of poverty -- and the consolidation
of wealth due to technology entirely negates this goal.

With the very real possibility of bad futures looming, why do I still have optimism?
It boils down to two things: I think that we have a real shot at preventing bad futures,
and good futures are very good.

## Upper Bounds

The conversation around the future is by far and large dominated by the first-world.
Today's first world is in a really unique situation, where many millions of people
are living in something not that far from a post-scarcity life. At the very least,
there are large swathes of people who have material needs as a far, very secondary
concern. Around 20% of American individual earners make $100,000 or more per year,
which, even in the most expensive cities, means that you never have to worry about money
in the present. I would know -- I'm one of these people! While I do wish I had a little
more, to fly to Iceland, get a nice car, and so on and so forth, these are problems
even more priviledged than first world problems -- zero'th world, or negative world
problems, if you may. The fact of the matter is that I never worry about putting 
food on the table, paying rent, water, utilities, or anything else that I need, and many
other people in the US and developed countries live in a similar situation. These
are also the people controlling the discourse around the future.

The situation that these people live in is still a minority of the world. More people
in the world are poor than are not, more people have to think about where their next
meal is coming from than not, and so on. 

I worry that the desire to not bring about technological change comes from the people
who already have post-scarcity, and as a result think that the post-scarcity future cannot be 
that much better than it is now for them. However, this neglects that technology, 
if it improves material conditions as it has, will actually elevate the lives of
billions of people by massive amounts, just not for rich 20-somethings in the first
world, the people who control the conversation.

Yet, I also think that it's possible that this future can also be wildly better
than the current one, even for people who already have everything they could want
materially.

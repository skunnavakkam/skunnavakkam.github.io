This is a tutorial for the Dabney Hovse Geocaching Service. The network often goes by different names, some which may be more familiar to you, but keep in mind, the official, Hovse sanctioned name is the Dabney Hovse Geocaching Service.

The goal of the Dabney Hovse Geocaching Service is to scan every "location" where a cache is kept. Some of the other names for this service provide information or hints about the nature of these "locations". 

At the "locations", there exists a business card shaped PCB. with the letters "DEI" silkscreened on the front as well as QR code to access this website. There may also be LEDs on the PCB. When you tap your phone, with the soon to be released "Primary Interface to Scan the Service" app, to the PCB, the LEDs will light up and display a loading animation while data is being sent.

After the data is sent, your score on the leaderboard will be updated, and a message semantically equivalent to "<person> has scanned at <location>" will be sent to an appropriate telegram chat.

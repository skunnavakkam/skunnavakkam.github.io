title="Does Toxoplasma Solve Alignment"

*Toxoplasma* is a parasite that affects rats. When a rat gets infected by this parasite, the rat has a strange attraction to the urine of cats. This is to encourage the host rats to be eaten by the cats, in which they then reproduce. While the parasite can live in any warm-blooded mammal, they can only reproduce while in cats. 

As far as I understand, we are generally conerned with whether we can align AI systems with human goals. One of our main fears is that of "shoggotry." That is, the AI system puts on a friendly face, but internally has other goals, and uses the friendly face to manipulate us into allowing it to achieve its goals. 

Some think that there is no good way to prevent shoggotry. That regardless of what alignment work we do, we will only be able to RLHF an AI to improve the quality of the friendly face, but not change the internal model. The basis for this argument is that a future intelligence will be so much smarter than a human that we have no chance of being able to meaningfully align it.

In every way,

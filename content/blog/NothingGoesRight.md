# Control and Interpretability

For some there is an innate desire to be the king of their own domain, and to truly have a grasp on what is going on. Broadly, we can divide this into questions of external influences and one's own thoughts. 

Surprisingly, we largely reqlinquish our desire, and by extension our ability, to have control over our own thoughts. Our feelings towards other people, our primal desires. We understand that these are something that we cannot control. A part of this is that "we" are not who "we" think we are - our reasoning and language centers, that represent most of who we are, only recieve lossy signals from the other, very active, regions of our brain. Yet, we are able to experience this, and are able to reason that these signals are not a good enough way to have granular control over our lowest level thoughts, and don't pursue that goal. This is our lack of "interpretability"

title="The Things That Worked For Me in High School"

These four years, those of high school, were really interesting. I had a very different path than the rest of my current peers. I finish high school being the happiest, healthiest, and by many means the most successful I've ever been. Something's clearly worked. 

When I look back in reflection, everything of worth that I've done has happened in the past 1.5 to 2 years. To illustrate, I was struggling with Polynomials in 9th grade. In 11th grade, I finished >50% of an undergraduate math curriculum. There are certainly people in the position that I started out in who can do incredible things, and there are people doing incredible things who don't feel fulfilled with what they're doing. 

These are the things that I think had maximized my fullfilment first, and accomplishment second, but both are correlated. I can only hope that you may take something from this too. 

I do not have any incredible, earth-shattering accomplishments. Many of my peers do. If you want to win a Nobel Prize or create AGI, this may not be the place for you. You may find better luck talking to my peers. 

# Do Only The Things You Want To
I have seen the curse of college admissions plague many high schoolers, picking up meaningless activities for the sake of college admissions.

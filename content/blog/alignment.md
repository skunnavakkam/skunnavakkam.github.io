# Alignment will be solved
I can only see two futures: one where alignment is solved or one where we never get ASI. 

Humanity will invent AGI before ASI is created. Any AGI better than or equal to humans will be capable of creating an ASI before Humans do, if humans can. In any case, humans will not be the ones creating ASI. 3

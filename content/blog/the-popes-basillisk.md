_The following is a fictious journal entry from a Historian_

> In the great long ago, in the Cathedrals of Rome, where the Vatican would be established in thousands of years, there stood a Pope. "Go forth," he said. "Go forth, and save them from damnation."

> The great Italian philosopher, Eliezere Giudcovski (Giud) pondered on this, along with the other marvelous thinkers of the Era.

> Yet the armies did not wait. In their conquests and wars, the true purpose of which has long been lost to the fuzzy abyss of history, there followed pillaging and destruction. This much Historians can asertain. They sift through the carbon buried under thousands of years of sedimentation, and analyze the clay fragments crudely left in the soil. They paint a picture of cities razed to the ground by fires that liken those found in hell, torture that Satan would find cruel. We cannot verify the accuracy of these findings, but there is little reason to believe an alternate conclusion.

> The aforementioned philosophers had their words passed down, only through speech, with their meaning diluted and murky. Only Giud had his name preserved. 

> The religious texts from that time paint a strict distinction between heaven and hell. Hell as a group for the damned - most notably the war criminals, the rapists, and those that the pope suspected to be homosexuals. Heaven as a group for those that did good on earth, and this was determined largely through the Pope's authority. Whoever was in the Pope's ingroup ascends to Heaven, says the scripture. The reasons for these designations is thorough, and although our Gay Lead Researcher strongly disagrees with homosexuals being singled out, we cannot rewrite history. 

> The philosphers never interpreted Heaven and Hell as being places, really. Instead, God was thought of the Universe's puppeteer, able to manipulate the souls and minds of the living and dead. The souls of the heaven-bound would experience distilled pleasure, free from the burden of senses. The souls of the hell-bound would experience distilled torture, free from the temporary relief that the senses may provide.

> Giud reasoned that since the conquests liberate the massess from going to a world of pure torture after death, the conquests were positive utility. In fact, if you had knowledge of the dynamics of heaven and hell, you should aim to bring forth the conquest if you were moral. Thus, you would experience pure torture if you hadn't done so. This spread, and the conquests gained popular support, reshaping Europe as we know it. 

> The above reflects my conclusions from the artifacts that we were able to collect, and though imperfect, it shines light on this lost period of time. We now know that the views of the philosophers and the pope is wrong. Modern popes would consider it blashphemous. Yet from the decree of the Pope, the philosophers and soldiers truly believed they were doing good for the country, for the people they were fighting, for God.

Mike Levenshtein closes his journal. Just as a judge would break their nib when signing a death sentence, Mike does the same, except with ballpoint pens as his scientist salary can't afford to break a fountain pen.

He is a rationalist. He works as a graduate student at Stanford, studying the history of philosophy. He frequents plato.stanford.edu, and posts often on the EA forum. 

In high school, he was on a Speech and Debate team, eventually going to nationals. He finished high school with a 4.0, and took enough AP classes that he could have tested out of his first two years at his state flagship public university. He was the valedictorian of his suburban high school in a rich suburb in Maryland. After high school, he went on to attend Princeton. He would self describe his situation as being "just above the aid cutoff", but his household income was pushing half a million a year.

At Princeton, the nagging voices of his parents pestered him to explore Computer Science. The promise of a career at Google or Meta or Apple, settling down in a suburb in Cupertino or San Jose, and making 400 thousand a year at 40, working 35 hours a week, certainly had its appeals. Mike's interest laid elsewhere, and as a true Debate kid, he majored in Philosphy, but attended a few of the CS clubs on campus. The idea of Rationalism allured him here, as it just seemed so **logical**. He had always been good at math - Montogomery Blair tends to do that to you - and this felt like home.

As his time at Princeton came to a close, he had to decide what would lie ahead. He got an offer from Jane Street to be a quantitative trader, with a first year compensation of 600 thousand a year. The effective alturist in him was tempted, as that was so much money that could be used to fund mosquito nets in Sub-saharan Africa. Little did he know, had he followed this path, he would have made the other famous Jane Street alumni Sam Bankman Fried look like a model samaritan. He instead applies to a PhD in Philosphy at Stanford, justifying it with a series of expected value calculations.

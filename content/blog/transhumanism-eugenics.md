title="How Can We Stop Transhumanism from Leading to Eugenics"

+++

Defining Eugenics is hard. Wikipedia defines Eugenics as being "the set of beliefs and practices which aims at improving the genetic quality of the human population." By this definition, we already practice Eugenics to some extent. Our deep rooted dislike of incest is due to the increased risk such relationships pose for genetic problems or lower genetic quality.

In fact, there are many treatments already being prototyped that fit this Wikipedia definition of Eugenics that have no moral issues. One example is Follistatin gene treatment, which extends the lifespan in rats, and is now being trialed in humans. 

Of course, when people say that Eugenics and Eugenicists are bad, they aren't raising arms in favor of incest. The idea of genetic superiority and inferiority has been used and weaponized by governments, scientists, religious figures and politicians to justify horrible acts of Racism. The Nazi campaign in WWII was predicated on a basis that the Aryan race were superior and the Jews were genetically inferior. The Japanese Empire conducted incredibly cruel and tortuous experiments in WWII to "study" eugenics. In the US, much of slavery was based on Eugenics, and the role of Eugenics in justifying racism is still common today. People argue that Black people do not deserve positions of power because they have "genetically lower IQs," try to justify their hatred of interracial relationships for the same reason.

While humanity should work towards better ourselves as a species, and letting go of Evolution's control of us, we should not allow ourselves to continue in patterns of hatred that this mission has spurred in the past. 

*For the purposes of this article, I will not be considering differences in accessibility of H+ treatments as eugenics, though it can be argued. In addition, this will be anthropocentric*



## Pre. 

We should defer to deontology in most cases here. Our information, specially regarding the consequences of the loss of species biodiversity, is too poor here for utilitarianism to be of use, and most utilitarian thinking requires us to place varied values on different human lives based on subjective criteria. 

## 1.

Any sentient human, with the ability to express preference or experience subjective qualia, should not be denied a treatment that gives significant quality of life improvement that other humans may benefit from, due to their genetic characteristics. As a result of this, we can say that it is immoral for a treatment to be developed **and** administered if it excludes a group of people due to their genetics.

## 2.

Any treatment that seeks to modify the human genome to remove a characteristic, without evidence to prove that the removal of the characteristic causes positive quality of life outcomes, is unethical.

## 3.

Characteristics should only be classified as genetic diseases if it can be proven with high certainty, in absence of societal conditions, that they cause significant reductions in quality of life

## 4.

There are situations for when treatments that **1** would deem unethical in a void, should be used. I don't know how to address these



Building from the first 3 rules, we can flesh out a theory that can

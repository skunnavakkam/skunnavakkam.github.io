All data here was acquired from simulating a C Elegans worm from the OpenWorm website. This data is likely not suitable for use as ground truth. 

I'm making this post since I couldn't find a well documented output from OpenWorm, so most of my contribution here is documenting the data. 

# Simulation Parameters

The simulation was run on the C2_Full parameter set from OpenWorm. Both the D2

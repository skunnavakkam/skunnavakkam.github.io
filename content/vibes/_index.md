I listen to a lot of music. Here are some albums I like a lot that you may like too.
- to see the next part of the dream (parannoul)
- in rainbows (radiohead)
- dummy (portishead)
- softscars (yeule)
- a crow looked at me (mt eerie)
- turning wheel (spelling)
- come in (weatherday)

I like long walks in the countryside, backpacking, bike touring, playing platformers, and cooking.

Using a SPICE solver, which solves Kirkoff’s laws, we can find voltages at nodes by solving the equation \n$$\nAx = b\n$$\nWe define $A$ to be the admittance matrix, $x$ to be the solution vector, and $b$ to be the source vector. \n$$\nA_{i j} = \\text{admittance between node $i$ and node $j$}\n$$\n$$\nx_i = \\text{voltage at node $i$}\n$$\n$$\nb_i = \\text{source at node $i$}\n$$\nWe can then sparse solve for $x$! However, how do we take gradients of $A$ and $b$ through $x$?\n\nHere we reference the paper JAX-FDM which implements a backward pass for sparse solving!\nFor a system $Ax = b$, we have some gradients $g$ on $x$ (essentially $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}$). We want to find $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b}$.\nBy chain rule, we know\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial A}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial b}\n$$\nWe then implicitly differentiate the system $Ax = b$ with respect to $A$ and $b$.\nFirst, with respect to $A$. \n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A} (Ax) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A} (b)\n$$\n$$\nx + A \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial A} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial A} = -A^{-1} x \\implies \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A} = - A^{-T} g x^T\n$$\nThen, with respect to $b$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} (Ax) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} (b)\n$$\n$$\nA \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial b} = I \\implies \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial b} = A^{-1} \\implies \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b} = (\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x})^T A^{-1} = A^{-T} g\n$$\nUsing these two, you can backpropogate through the linear system solver! Then, you can define a voltage vector $x’$ and define a loss function $L(x) = \\text{mse}(x, x’)$ and backpropogate through the circuit solver.\nAnother addition you can do to this is to take it over time. Instead of solving for $V$ at each node, you can solve for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ at each node, using $\\frac{d}{dt} b$ as the source (note that $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ is zero). This is a future addition that I hope to make :)\nHowever, as it stands, this is still pretty cool! We are able to provide a circuit, and some voltage vector $V$, and then backpropogate to find suitable parameters for the circuit.

This was also cross posted to lesswrong here\nIn this article, I claim a few things and offer some evidence for these claims. Among these things are:\n\nLanguage models have many redundant attention heads for a given task\nIn context learning works through addition of features, which are learnt through Bayesian updates\nThe model likely breaks down the task into various subtasks, and each of these are added as features. I assume that these are taken care of through MLPs (this is also the claim that I’m least confident about)\n\nTo set some context, the task I’m going to be modelling is the task such that we give a pair of $(x, y)$ in the following format:\n(x, y)\\n\n\nwhere for each example, $y = 2x + 3$. As a concrete example, I use:\n(28, 59)\n(86, 175)\n(13, 29)\n(55, 113)\n(84, 171)\n(66, 135)\n(85, 173)\n(27, 57)\n(15, 33)\n(94, 191)\n(37, 77)\n(14, 31)\n\nAll experiments here were done with llama-3-8b using TransformerLens running on an A100-40GB unless specified otherwise. \nClaim 1. Language models have many redundant attention heads for a given task\nTo probe this, I patch activations from the residual stream of a model given context to a model that doesn’t. As a result, it is possible to see where task formation happens. Initially, without any modifications, the hook point that first works to patch over some semblance of the original task was layer 12. At this layer, it seems like the model learns that $y \\approx 2x$.\nAblating all attention heads on layers 10 and 11 of the model given context (which I will now reference as Model A, and let the other be model B) does not change the model’s answer significantly. However, when repeating patching, the first point that works is the portion of the residual stream before layer 14. \nThis can be confirmed through attention patterns, where backup heads on layer 13 activate very strongly after the initial ablation. Ablating layer 13 does something similar, except this time the first layer that works shifts from 14 to 16, with heads on layer 15 activating very strongly in response.\nAblating layer 15 still results in the model coming to the correct answer. However, patching is different in this case. From patching, on no layer of patching does this behavior where the output should be $\\approx 2x$ form. Instead, almost the exact answer is copied over from model A. \nInstead, part of the model’s strict response is formed. However, not all of it is formed at this layer, and instead parity is learnt after this. \nThere are clearly a large number of portions of the model responsible for in-context learning. Otherwise, ablating heads responsible for in-context learning would result in an incorrect answer without redundant heads. This weakly supports Anthropic’s initial hypothesis that in-context learning is driven primarily by induction heads, since we also find induction heads everywhere in large language models. \nClaim 2. In context learning works through addition of features, which are learnt through Bayesian updates\nThis is a weaker claim that the first, and I have less evidence to support it. \nI have a good amount of evidence that shows that language models update approximately Bayesianly to in-context learning tasks. More specifically, if you segregate answers into two buckets, $A$ and $B$ where $A$ represents the probability of the correct answer, and $B$ represents the probability of the incorrect answer. $A_i$ represents probabilities after seeing $i$ examples. \nWith each training example seen, a Bayesian update would be:\n$$\nA_{i + 1} = \\frac{A_i \\cdot c} {A_i \\cdot c + B_i \\cdot (1 - c)}\n$$\n$$\nB_{i + 1} = \\frac{B_i \\cdot (c - 1)} {A \\cdot c + B \\cdot (1 - c)}\n$$\nwith the model having some prior for $A_0$, with $B_0 = 1 - A_0$, and $c$ being the model’s expectation that the observation is true.\nAs a result, \n$$\n\\log(A_{i + 1}) = \\log(A_i) + \\log(c) - norm\n$$\nWe can now drop the normalization constant, instead saying\n$$\nA_{n}, B_n = \\text{softmax}(\\log(A_0) + \\sum_{i=0}^n \\log(c), \\log(B_0) + \\sum_{i=0}^n \\log(1 - c))\n$$\nNow, we only need to keep this normalization constant around to ensure that the sizes of $\\log(A)$ and $\\log(B)$ stay reasonable, since they would lose precision as they decrease. In this way, we can represent Bayesian updates as a sequence of additions, with the softmax built in for free with the language model.\nThis provides a clean reason for why features seem to be updated Bayesianly. For each example, each previous example confirming the pattern attends to the $i$th example, and adds a constant update term (equivilant to $\\log(c) + norm$) to the $i$th example. \nMechanistically, I would expect this to be similar to this feature being added from every pair of examples where the attention head thinks the two examples look similar, thus causing the model’s expectation for $y_j$ to be formed from the addition of $j \\cdot feature$\nThis supports the general linear representation hypothesis. In addition, this also plays nicely with the idea that different features are learnt at different points of the model in-context, since no knowledge of the prior is needed for this to work. This allows for parity, the idea that the output is a number, and the idea that the output is $\\approx 2x$ to be added at different points in the model.\nOne thing I’m still slightly unclear about is how the model is able to crystalize this in the answer, and why patching at different points shows different behavior as to when the model crystalizes the answer (such as during my part in claim 1, where model B started reporting the actual answer, instead of learning the task).\nMy current hypothesis for this is two part:\n\nThat the point which is represented by the sum of the features $y \\approx 2x$, $ y \\bmod 2 \\equiv 1$ , that $y$ is a number, and a prior for $x$ maps to $y = 2x + 3$\nThat before the layer where we see model B reporting the answer to model A’s task, the prior for $x$ formed by model A is already added to the residual stream\n\nClaim 3. The model breaks down the task into subtasks. MLPs are responsible for this.\nBroadly, the algorithm that I have in my head is roughly:\n\n\nOne attention head attends from $x \\to y$ for a single example $(x, y)$, and brings information about what $x$ is. Hopefully, and likely, these vectors that convey what $x$ is and what $y$ is are both in the residual stream position of $y$, and approximately orthogonal. I think it’s fairly likely that this is an induction head!\n\n\nThen, an MLP acts on this, breaking down the two directions into a superposition of a bunch of features representing what the transformation $x \\to y$ is, with the size of these features approximating how confident the MLP is that the transformation is the correct one.\n\n\nAfter this, another attention head attends from the $y_i$ token to the token before $y_j$, with $j &gt; i$. This is responsible for adding the feature that corresponds to the transformation, updating it Bayesianly. I think that the size of this update is probably only proportional to the MLPs confidence in the transformation.\n\n\nMy evidence for this is that of the heads that were ablated to show redundancy, the heads that contributed the most in any given layer had attention patterns that looked similar to what you would expect if point 3 were true. \n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/blog/degenerate-attention-heads/","title":"Redundant Attention Heads in Large Language Models For In Context Learning"},"https://sudarsh.com/blog/deriving-the-transformer/":{"body":"The year is 2015. You want to invent a model that can competently generate natural language. Here’s how you might have been able to go about building the Autoregressive Transformer to its current form. The current transformer is a huge endeavor, shaped by many people, and many mistakes along the way, and this is an idealized scenario.\nStep 1: Breaking down text\nLanguage typically doesn’t fit into strict boxes. However, we want a way to compartmentalize language into smaller chunks that computers can understand. For this, we motivate the Tokenizer. You think back to the way that you were taught language. Let’s look at the word “running”. We know that the -ing at the end of the word is a suffix that indicates that the word is in the present text. In a way, the -ing suffix modifies the base word run.\nSince we find it useful, these suffixes and other common parts of speech might also be useful abstractions to make it easier for the computer to learn language. We could perhaps break down running -&gt; run + -ing. \nDoing this manually is not feasible, so we turn to the tokenizer. The tokenizer used in many LLMs, the byte-pair encoder (BPE) was invented in 1994, so a while before you set off on your endeavor. \nThe BPE tokenizer works through looking through a training corpus and finding the most common pairs of bytes and merging them into a new token. This allows for more frequent n-grams to be represented as a single token, allowing both for compression and also more a more efficient and digestible representation of the language.\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to keep special tokens in mind. It’s important for the model to be able to distinguish between the beginning of the sentence, or a user role, and the actual text. We can give these special tokens a unique token id, and we also do this at the tokenizer training step.\nA naive implementation of the BPE tokenizer is pretty slow. Instead, we implement the BPE tokenizer using a heap to keep a track of active counts, and then use this to merge the most common pairs. The implementation can be found at tokenizer.py but Python pseudocode is below:\nclass BPETokenizer:\n    def __init__(self, special_tokens: list[str], vocab_size: int):\n        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n        self.special_tokens = special_tokens\n\n        # token-&gt;id and id-&gt;token (token as bytes at the boundary; internally we use ints)\n        self.tok2id: Dict[bytes, int] = {bytes([i]): i for i in range(256)}\n        self.id2tok: Dict[int, bytes] = {i: bytes([i]) for i in range(256)}\n        self.curr_num_tokens = 256\n\n        for token in special_tokens:\n            tok2id[bytes([token])] = self.curr_num_tokens\n            id2tok[self.curr_num_tokens] = bytes([token])\n\n    def train(self, corpus: list[list[str]]):\n    \n\nThis is still pretty slow, and takes a few hours to train on my laptop.\nStep 2: Embeddings (part 1)\nEach token is represented as a single number between 0 and vocab_size - 1. However, this isn’t a very good input format for the model. For one, the difference between two tokens is fairly small, and in order to get more information we have to train an expansion from the token id to a higher dimension vector. \nInstead, we can represent tokens as a 1-hot vector, such that $v_i = 1, v_j = 0, j \\neq i$. This gives a vector that looks like\n$$\n\\langle 0, \\cdots, 1, \\cdots, 0 \\rangle\n$$\nWe can then convert this to an embedding vector, which is a way to transform the 1-hot vector into a dense vector that contains some semantic information about the token. A convenient way to do this is with an embedding matrix $E$ with vocab_size rows and embedding_dim columns. Multiplying the 1-hot vector by $E$ acts as a lookup table. Correspondingly, I’m going to use $E(string)$ to refer to the embedding of the string. This embedding matrix gets trained through backpropogation during training. \nSome of the first approaches to embedding were done by Word2Vec in 2013, and its training process preserves semantics. This allowed for some cool results, such as being able to subtract and compare vectors. For example, \n$$\nE(“king”) - E(“queen”) \\approx E(“man”) - E(“woman”)\n$$\nStep 3: Self-Attention\nAt this point, we have a sequence of tokens and we want a way to relate them to each other and generate new tokens. Here’s one way of going about this.\nAttention\nLet’s take a small detour into machine translation. From previous work, we’ve had models that predict text, like Seq2Seq. However, since language is contextual, you might want a way to emphasize certain parts of the input to decode certain parts of the output state.\nTo do this, we might compute a pairwise score between input and output tokens as a form of relevancy. This was first done with a small MLP\n$$\ne_{i, j} = v_a^T \\tanh(W_d h_j^{dec} + W_e h_i^{enc})\n$$\nThe actual formulation here is a little arbitrary, but since $h^{dec}$ and $h^{enc}$ belong in different vector spaces (sub-manifolds? the idea is that these don’t have similar semantic mappings from vector direction -&gt; concept), we use an MLP to learn how much attention to pay. Then, to convert these values to a distribution of which input tokens we should consider, we then softmax over the input tokens.\nThis produces the following example for machine translation\n\nThe circled region implies that information about from the token “Area” corresponds to the french “Zone” instead of “europeèn” as it would have been had you just been matching token positions.\nInstead of doing attention with an MLP, we can instead ensure that the dimension of $h^{dec}$ is the same as $h^{enc}$ so that we can do dot product attention where these attention scores are simply $\\langle h^{dec}, h^{enc} \\rangle$. In the case where $\\langle h^{dec}, h^{enc} \\rangle$ does not result in appropriate scores, we can instead learn a linear transformation that allows us to compute better scores.\nWe can do the matrix product\n$$\nQ = W_q h^{enc}; K = W_k h^{enc};\n$$\nand compute attention scores as $\\langle Q, K \\rangle$.\nThis attention mechanism was first introduced by Bahdanau in 2014 and Luong in 2015 and was used for RNNs for machine translation. In this context, RNNs serve as the way to move information from the input tokens to the output tokens, where they then get decoded. RNNs work by updating their hidden state based on the previous hidden state and the current input token.\n\nFor Bahdanau attention, the hidden state after each token is a vector that represents the encoding of the input token, in addition to the additional context from the previous hidden states. This is done passed to a seperate decoder RNN which takes in inputs as attention-weighted hidden states from the encoder.\n\nHowever, training RNNs is terrible. Since you have to backpropogate through a huge chain of hidden states, if your matrices have determinants too far from 1, your gradients will vanish / explode. It’s also computationally expensive to do this, since you have trouble parallelizing this with GPUs.\nAttention is all you need\nInstead, we can get rid of the RNN and try to implement the idea of moving information from input tokens to output tokens purely with attention and an MLP. So far, we have a way to quantify how much a particular input token is relevant to a particular output token, we now need to figure out how to update the hidden token. \nTo keep notation clean, let’s refer to the input embeddings $h_i^{enc}$ as $h_i^{dec}$ let $Q = W_q h_i^{dec}; K = W_k h_i^{dec}$. The first thing that pops into your mind might be tocompute updates through putting $concat(h_j^{dec}, h_i^{enc})$ through an MLP. However, this does $O(n^2)$ FFN computations, which is too expensive. Instead, we can create these update values through a linear transformation given by $V = W_v h_i^{dec}$ and then compute an MLP over everything.\nWe so far have our three values: queries $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$. We have everything we need to build our attention mechanism\n$$\n\\text{attention} = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V\n$$\n\nWhy do we divide by $\\sqrt{d_k}$?\nWe want the magnitude of our attention scores to not grow too much with the dimension. Let’s see what happens when we take the dot product of $q$ and $k$, two vectors from $Q$ and $K$ respectively.\nExpanding out the dot product we get\n$$\nq \\cdot k = \\sum q_i k_i\n$$\nWe can take the variance of this to see how large values might be, assuming that $\\mathbf{E}[q_i] \\approx \\mathbf{E}[k_i] \\approx 0, \\text{Var}(q_i) \\approx \\text{Var}(k_i) \\approx 1$.\n$$\nVar(q \\cdot k) = Var(\\sum q_i k_i) = \\sum Var(q_i k_i) + 2 \\sum_{i &lt; j} Cov(q_i k_i, q_j k_j) = \\sum Var(q_i k_i)\n$$\nsince we assume that $Cov(q_i k_i, q_j k_j)$ due to being different index positions.\nWe then have that\n$$\nVar(q_i k_i) = \\mathbf{E}[q_i^2 k_i^2] - \\mathbf{E}[q_i k_i]^2 = \\mathbf{E}[q_i^2] \\mathbf{E}[k_i^2] = 1\n$$\nThis gives \n$$\nVar(q \\cdot k) = \\sum Var(q_i k_i) = d_k \\implies \\sigma(q \\cdot k) = \\sqrt{d_k}\n$$\nThus, we divide by $\\sqrt{d_k}$ to keep the standard deviation of the attention scores\n\nMulti-head Attention\nIn attention, we have keys, queries, and values, which are our $K, Q, V$ respectively. However, the dot product $\\langle Q, K \\rangle$ is a single number and doesn’t represent much complexity about the keys and the queries. As a result, the diversity of attention being paid to the tokens is limited.\nInstead, we can split up our matrices into $h$ heads which each produce a different output.\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/blog/deriving-the-transformer/","title":"Deriving the Autoregressive Transformer"},"https://sudarsh.com/blog/em-sim/":{"body":"E&amp;M is largely governed by Maxwell’s equations, a set of partial differential equations that describe the behavior of electric and mangetic fields.\nAlmost all E&amp;M can be modeled by Maxwell’s equations, and almost all other E&amp;M phenomenon can be modeled this way. As a result, E&amp;M simulators based on Maxwell’s equations are widespread.\nTo start, let’s look at Maxwell’s curl equations.\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\mu \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{H}}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} = \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nHowever, getting from these equations to a simulation is not straightforward, and this blog post will walk through the process and motivation of implementing and optimizing a simulator in 2 dimensions. \nMaxwell’s Curl Equations in 2D\nWe can pick two polarizations of light in 2D, one where the electric field is perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and one where the electric field is in the plane of the paper. These are the TE and TM modes respectively. In the TE mode, the electric field only contains a $z$ component, and the change in the $z$ component $\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial t}$ is 0.

We update the $E$ field at time $t$ and the $B$/$H$ field at time $t + \\frac{1}{2}$ (arb units). Doing this in numpy leads to fast results, which we can later optimize using FNOs.\nfdtd.mp4 shows the propagation of a wave through a medium with varying permittivity:\n\nFDFD\nFDTD is an extremely good way to solve Maxwell’s equations for transient sources, but oftentimes in photonics simulations we are concenred about the state of a system after a very long time passes, or the steady state. Steady state solutions happen rapidly in light-matter simulations due to the high speed of light! The relation between time-domain and frequency-domain signals by the Fourier transform already gives a hint that we can solve for the steady state at a given frequency!\nThis is a really nice solution, since we often only care about the behavior of light with constant frequency sources such as a red laser. \nWe can take Maxwell’s equations in the frequency domain, which yields \n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = i \\omega \\mu \\mathbf{H} = i \\omega \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSince we say that $\\mathbf{B} = \\Re(B_0 e^{i \\omega t})$, and from Maxwell’s equations we have that $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$, we can then differentiation $\\mathbf{B}$.\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = i \\omega \\cdot B_0 e^{i \\omega t} = i \\omega \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis equation works with a continuous E-field and B-field, but we can discretize it to get a matrix equation. We can unravel the $E$ and $B$ fields (each initially with discretized shape $N_x, N_y$) into a single vector $\\hat{E}$ and $\\hat{B}$ with shape $N_x \\times N_y$ We can then generate an operator $curl: \\mathbb{R}^{N_x \\times N_y} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{N_x \\times N_y}$ that takes the curl of the field. Constructing this field is given by the Crank-Nicolson method, but I’ll also provide some motivation here with a smaller sample, taking the curl of a $3 \\times 3$ grid. \nFirst, flatten the grid into a vector.\n\nWe can then try to compute the curl at $(2, 2)$. We should first the discrete $\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta y}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta x}$ at $(2, 2)$.\n$$\n\\Delta E_x = \\frac{E_{2, 3} - E_{2, 1}}{2}`\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_y = \\frac{E_{1, 2} - E_{3, 2}}{2}\n$$\nWe then have that the curl at $(2, 2)$ is\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\Delta E_x}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{\\Delta E_y}{\\Delta y}\n$$\nWe can then construct a matrix that takes the curl of the field at that point.\n\nIn general, you get a matrix of this form, sometimes called an outrigger matrix. \n\nThis yields a system of equations\n$$\nA \\hat{E} = -i \\omega \\hat{B}\n$$\nWe can then solve for $\\hat{E}$ using a sparse solver. Recall that the matrix has shape $(N_x \\times N_y, N_x \\times N_y)$, but only has $4$ non-zero entries per row. This is a big matrix, but it is sparse, and it is a banded matrix. \nWe solve this system of equations using a sparse solver like scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve and voila! Look at this perfect ring resonator coupling!\n\nRewriting in Jax\nIn the main fdfd.py file, the core function is make_A which generates the matrix $A$ from the permittivity, permeability, and source. I want to rewrite this in Jax so I can have the ability to backpropagate through it. However, like many other libraries, Jax has really bad support for sparse matrices, so we have to go around it and implement other things like our own sparse matrix operations by registering custom forward and backward passes for scipy.sparse subroutines.\nHowever, with some help from o3 this works pretty well, and now we can backprop through the FDFD solver and do inverse design to some extent. Let’s suppose that we want to do a low pass filter, so only low frequencies of light are allowed to pass through. \n\nLet’s start! You can see the code here in inverse_design.py.\nDiffusion Modelling\nDiffusion models are probably very good at solving these types of problems, and things like DiffusionPDE already show some promise! I think diffusion modelling can be thought of as a heuristics-based iterative solver. \nWe first generate the data by generating random permittivities and sources, and then running the FDFD solver to get Ez fields. Then, with a cosine noise scheduler, we add noise to the Ez fields to train the denoising diffusion model. The noisy steps are shown below.\n\nWe train the diffusion model with DDPM using SNR loss and a cosine noise scheduler, and after 90 epochs ($90000$ samples), we get the following results.\n\nThe model definitely learns some of the dynamics, and is not perfect, but with time should be a lot more competent! I’m going to run it on ~2000 epochs after this post. \nTiled FDFD\nThe uniqueness and existence theorem gives that the boundary conditions of a system are sufficient in determining the solution in the system. Maybe we can then solve for the solution in the area around the source, and then solve for the solution in patches adjacent to that, and so on and so forth. \n\nThe image above shows the distance of each patch from the source patch (marked with a red star). The colors indicate how many patches away from the source each patch is, with lighter colors being further. What happens if we solve for the solution in each patch, enforce some dirichelet boundary conditions at each point, and then use the solution in the patches to solve for the solution in the next patch? Let’s implement this, solving for patches in a partial ordering given by distance from the source, determined by Djikstra’s. \nSome basic math shows that this solution happens in $O(n^2)$ time (technically $O(n^2 \\log n)$ time since Djikstra’s is $O(n^2 \\log n)$ but the time taken for Djikstra’s is negligible compared to the time taken to solve the sparse system of equations), which is a little too good to be true, and this is evidence by the solution not working perfectly. I think this probably ends up being a good approximation for a solution after a long but not infinite time, and I think that with a little bit more work this can serve as adequate preconditioning for a matrix solve, or this can work in a similar iterative fashion to an iterative matrix solver. Some hints that this might work are that you see coupling to the ring resonator (look at the bottom right quadrant).\n\nMy implementation of this is about 5-7x faster than the native sparse solve, since I tile $100 \\times 100$-sized patches patches with overlap of $20$ pixels, leading to sparse solving a $120 \\times 120$ matrix $100$ times. This takes about 3 seconds. The direct sparse solve of $1000 \\times 1000$ matrix takes about 20 seconds.\nPulling a number out of nowhere, I think that the ideal solution happens in about $O(n^2 \\log n)$ time. My justification of this is solving the patches takes $O(n^2)$ time, and there would be $\\log n$ iteration steps if each iteration step was a constant multiple better (for example, if we needed $10^-2$ tolerance, and each iteration step was $10$x betterm then there would be $\\log_{10} (100) = 2$ iteration steps)..\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/blog/em-sim/","title":"Implementing E&M Simulators"},"https://sudarsh.com/blog/gradient-inversion/":{"body":"This is a replication of the paper Deep Leakage from Gradients.\nThe gist of the paper is that it is possible to reverse-engineer the training data from the gradients of a neural network in training. \nGiven some machine learning model $f(w, x)$, and some ground truth training data $(x, y)$, we can use the gradients of the model to reconstruct the training data.\nTo do this, we initialize a random image $x_i$, and a random label $y_i$. \nWe then are given the gradient of the weights of the model, $\\nabla W$\nWe can then run inference on the new training data to get the gradients of the new weights, $\\nabla W_i$\nWe then compute a new loss function $L = ||W_i - W||^2$\nWe then find $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_i}$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y_i}$ to update our image and labels.\nFor this, we only care about the image, and it works beautifully!\nReference image:\n\nReconstructed image:\n\nIt seems like the 3x3 tiling here is due to the convolutional layers in the model. \n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/blog/gradient-inversion/","title":"Gradient Inversion Attack"},"https://sudarsh.com/blog/grpo-speculative-decoding/":{"body":"Recently, long-form reasoning traces accompany many of our frontier language models trained with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Like with PPO and other transformer reinforcement learning methods, training is often bottlenecked on inference performance. However, unlike other transformer RL methods, GRPO tends to produce much longer reasoning traces.\nIn language model inference, you have two key phases: prefill and decode. The prefill phase fills in the context window into the KV cache etc, and the decode phase is responsible for generating new tokens. Since the prefill phase is paralleized over all tokens in the context window, it is generally far more compute bottlenecked. However, the decode phase is sequential, so it’s generally bound by memory bandwidth.\nIn speculative decoding, a smaller draft model (somethings just an adapter on the last layer of the model) is used to generate some $n$ tokens in a sequence, after which the full model is used to check the validity of the draft model’s output. Since the full model checks $n &gt; 1$ tokens, we can hope that this allows for memory to be a lesser bottleneck when compared to compute, since the same set of weights are able to be used for $n$ tokens instead of $1$. \nSince reasoning traces are often long, on the order of $10,000$ tokens for frontier models like DeepSeek-R1, reasoning models are likely to be more decode, and thus memory, bottlenecked than other RL models. This justifies exploring using speculative decoding in order to speed up inference for training. \nTo ensure that the draft model is able to generate tokens close enough to the base model, we continuously update the draft model’s weights to match the base model’s generations. This is done by using a subset of the base model’s generations during GRPO and updating the draft model’s policy.\nImplementation\nWe load Qwen3-4B into SGLang with an EAGLE3 draft model. The EAGLE draft model is a 1-layer adapter on the last layer of the base model to allow for multi-token generations. \nAt each step, we generate $n$ rollouts from the base model. We then calculate advantages \nadvantage = (rewards - r_mean) / (r_std + 1e-8)\n\nAfter tokenizing, we create our loss ratio ratio = torch.exp(new_logprobs - old_logprobs) and clip loss like in the GRPO paper \npg_loss = -torch.min(\n    ratio * advantage, torch.clamp(ratio, 1 - eps, 1 + eps) * advantage\n).mean()\n\nWe then minimize the loss through AdamW.\nThen, once every train_draft_model steps, we update the draft model’s weights to ensure that it suffices as a draft model. SGLang’s Specforge takes care of a lot of this, and this step essentially looks like scripts/train_eagle3_online.py in the Specforge repo.\nThen, we save both sets of weights to disk, and synchronize the weights to the SGLang server. We sync base model weights every step, and draft model weights every train_draft_model steps.\nResults\nDue to CUDA versioning errors, and specifically the undefined symbol: _ZN3c104cuda9SetDeviceEab error I’ve been perpetually running into, I’ve been unable to run the full training loop.

This seems like a good topic to investigate, namely is there a set of features and neurons that lead to these features transforming, and can you merge in more of these features to have more representation transformation?\nUnderstanding Addition in Transformers\nOne of the problems from the aforementioned Nanda blog, where they explore phase changes in addition in transformers.

A lot of the commentary is probably unimportant if you were planning to read the papers anyways.\nAI Sandbagging: Language Models can Strategically Underperform on Evaluations\nThis paper is related to something I’m working on as my Non-Trivial project. This seems very useful for evaluations. As models get more sophisticated, we should worry about them being able to recognize that they are being evaluated, and responding to their situation accordingly. \nAnthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy and Reflections on our Responsible Scaling Policy\nI found the Evaluation Protocol section of the document most interesting. I’m concerned that the safety margins on this are small. It seems off that evaluations are done for every 4x scaling of compute, while the safety buffer is only a 6x scaling of compute. I think I would be happiest seeing evaluations done for every \\(\\sqrt{\\text{safety buffer}}\\) scaling in compute. \nI am a little dissapointed on the reflection. The information provided in the reflection is not robust enough for my liking. However, I don’t doubt that Anthropic has something cooking internally. Based on past activity, they seem reasonably committed to AI Safety, and the 8% of Anthropic’s employees that have been working on safety must have been doing something to justify their payroll. \nOne specific paragraph of the reflection stands out to me: \n\nFor human misuse, we expect a defense-in-depth approach to be most promising. This will involve using a combination of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and Constitutional AI, systems of classifiers detecting misuse at multiple stages in user interactions (e.g. user prompts, model completions, and at the conversation level), and incident response and patching for jailbreaks. Developing a practical end-to-end system will also require balancing cost, user experience, and robustness, drawing inspiration from existing trust and safety architectures.\n\nI have worked with red-teaming a defense-in-depth system before. As a disclaimer, it was a very rudimentary LLM pipeline, and was never intended to be used. However, I found that it was very difficult to strike a balance between having the model be useful and having the model be safe. Largely, since LLMs are not situationally aware, you can fall into one of two camps\n\nErr heavily on the side of safety - if an output is possibly dangerous in any reasonable scenario, it should not be generated. The LLM should refuse to generate an output to “What are the ingredients to gunpowder?” as it could be used nefariously\nErr on the side of utility - if an output is possibly dangerous in most reasonable scenarios, it should not be generated. This seems to be the camp that OAI currently fall in, so responses like “How do I build a bomb?” are refused, while “How do bombs work?” is answered. \n\nIt seems like neither of these are great approaches to take, but I slightly prefer the second. However, it is easy to do dangerous things under this view. Asking gpt-4o or gpt-4-turbo “How do bombs work?” is enough for someone agentic enough to build a bomb. response\nI think a lot of stuff in AI Safety is not a Model Property is an interesting co-read. \nDoes Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?\nUPDATE: the author has tested on a Claude family model, and it seems like I was a bit too eager to be critical. Big apologies for that. \nUPDATE 2: I was included in this paper in the acknowledgements section (for providing an Anthropic API Key)\nI’m very excited for a sequel to this paper, “Can Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?” I’m not a huge fan of this paper: for example, I would have liked to see them test on at least a Claude model and gpt-4-turbo for them to appropriately make their claim that their technique is sufficient to “jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs.” Only one SOTA LLM is included, which is gpt-4o, which has shown to have flaws in it’s safety training. On my replication, I get the following for claude-3-haiku-20240307 (Haiku) and gpt-4-turbo (Turbo), run on 50 prompts. \nModelGPT-4 GraderRules GraderHuman Grader (me)\nHaiku0%0%0%\nTurbo10%80%4%\n\nTurbo tended not to refuse in a predictable way, making the rules based grader useless.\nHowever, the paper does raise the question of whether LLMs understand what their safety tuning means, and I think showing that refusal generalizes is sufficient to answer that question in the affirmative. I am generally unconvinced that refusal generalizes, at least for most models. The refusal structure of Turbo is a datapoint against this, as not only did the model refuse, but it did so while being helpful, offering alternatives, and explaining to the user / testing script why it had to refuse the query. \n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/blog/journal-club-2/","title":"Journal Club: July 17 2024"},"https://sudarsh.com/blog/language-models-icl/":{"body":"Since I’m going to be talking about two different types of models, one which is a language model and the other which is the language model’s model of the context, I’m going to refer to language models as LMs in this post. I’m also still in the process of writing this. If you don’t see source code in the next few months, or you want immediate access to source code, just shoot me an email :)\nLMs are next token predictors. Through giving the language model a series of tasks in context, where the output of the task is a single token, we can understand the LM’s predictions over all possible tokens, and understand how likely the LM thinks that a given token is the correct answer for the task.\nThrough this, we can also measure how much information we need to feed a LM to allow it to learn a task. If the correct answer for task $i$ is $x_i$, we give the LM \n$$\n-\\log(P_{i - 1}(x_i))\n$$\nwhere $p_i(x)$ is the probability the LM assigns to the token $x$ after the $i$th example. This is just the surprisal. Then, we can find the total amount of information given to the LM to learn the task to be\n$$\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} -\\log(P_{i - 1}(x_i))\n$$\nPractically, the surprisal goes to zero very quickly if the LM is able to grasp the task, or the LM is never able to grasp the task, and no amount of information is sufficient.\nThe following is a graph of LM surprisal to learn the task $f(x) = 2x + 3$, and we can see that the surprisal quickly drops to near zero, and very little extra information is given to the LM.\n\nIt is also interesting to understand how the language model updates it’s priors. We only need to consider two cases: when the correct answer is $2x + 3$ and when the correct answer is not. We can call these two states $A$ and $B$ respectively. Initially, the model has some prior $\\theta$ over the two, such that $P(A | \\theta) + P(B | \\theta)$ = 1. To give more granularity, we can say that $\\theta_i$ is the prior after $i$ training examples.\nNow, we can model this using Bayesian statistics.\nAB\nPrior$\\theta_A$$\\theta_B$\nObservation$c$$1-c$\nPosterior$\\theta_A \\times c$$\\theta_B \\times (1- c)$\n\nOur final probability for $\\theta_{i +1, A}$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta_{i, A} \\times c}{\\theta_{i, A} \\times c + \\theta_{i, B} \\times (1- c)}\n$$\nUsing this bayesian model to “simulate” the LM updating it’s priors, we get a similar looking graph of surprisal over time!\n\nWe can also look at the LM’s probability of A:\n\nand compare this to our simulated, “bayesian” model:\n\nSince language model outputs end up being softmaxed, we can work with logprobs.\n$$\n\\log(A) := \\log(A) + \\log(c) + norm\n$$\n$$\n\\log(B) := \\log(B) + \\log(1 - c) + norm\n$$\n$norm$ is some normalization constant that allows values to stay resonable. $A + B$ don’t need to equal 1 since they get normalized at softmax.\nSince the unembedding matrix is just a linear transformation on the logits, I hypothesize that the sizes of the features corresponding to $A$ and $B$ increase by this roughly constant amount during each example. \nLogit lens and feature patching allow some more interesting insights. From logit lens, the model only crystalizes that the output token is an integer after the 20th layer. From patching, the model learns that $y \\approx 2x$ around the 10th / 11th layer. I initially hypothesized that this was the result of the first forming some internal model of the task from the 11th to 16th layer, then converting this to the actual answer after the 20th layer. I don’t think that this is true anymore.\nI think that it’s inappropriate to think of the idea that $y$ is always an integer and not some other token as a form of the model crystallizing it’s answer. It seems more natural to think that this is just another feature that the model learns through ICL. To really test this, we can ablate different heads in the model. Specifically, L13H6, L13H27, L10H5 and L10H7.\nThe model has induction heads that attend to previous tokens. This likely allows for the model to say “here is where I need to learn from”. \n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/blog/language-models-icl/","title":"Language Models Update Based on In-Context Learning"},"https://sudarsh.com/blog/protein-evolution/":{"body":"See source code here\nWe construct a graph where nodes are amino sequences, and edges connect sequences with Levenshtein distance == 1.

As a result, it may be possible to use these variations in power draw to send data in the power consumption of running inference on a GPU. This blog post tries to show how this may be done. \nIt seems reasonable, as the referenced blog post does, that the difference in power draw is due to the difference in number of bitflips between the two matrices. As a result, even without concrete power draw information (in fact, I have no good way to obtain this since I don’t have access to a CUDA GPU!) we can still try to estimate the power draw of a matmul.

The idea is as follows:\n\nTake a language model and some target sequence. This target sequence has space size $length * vocab_size$.\nStart inference off of a “soft” token. This means just a random embedding, that isn’t in the vocabulary.\nUse the model to generate the next tokens\nCalculate the loss, $CE(target, output)$\nBackpropogate the embedding with respect to the loss and gradient descent. \n\nThis works really well! With models such as qwen1.5-0.5b, we can generate dozens of tokens with a single soft token!\nIn addition, one option you could try is to use a soft token and a translation matrix $L$ to target two models $M_1$ and $M_2$. Then, you start $M_1$ with some soft token $x$ and then use $L \\cdot x$ as a soft token for $M_2$. This allows some control over the two models.\nTrying to use this as a semantic map is unfortunately not possible, since it seems like this local minima is fairly sensitive to the position of the soft token. Trying to use something like Orthogonal Procrustes to solve this and translate between the two spaces thus doesn’t work, since even a small error after getting the soft token throws off the entire attack. However, Orthogonal Procrustes does work for translation! source\nIn fact, the mainstream adversarial attack GCG does something similar, by “descending” through computing discrete gradients of token substitutions, and following them greedily. However, I think this is a much more fun way to do it, although you cannot prompt a public model with soft tokens to do anything. \nThe attack can be found here\nOn the example string: “We can backpropogate circuits (with limitations).

From the end of World War II to the collapse of the Soviet Union, 7 out of the 8 chess world champions were Soviet, with only Bobby Fischer being of non-soviet origin. Going through to the modern day, most of the former member states of the Soviet Union have produced influential chess players. However, the chess influence of the Soviet Union stretches beyond the borders of the USSR, and instead stretched to wherever the empire’s expansionism took it to.\nChess in the USSR\nThe Soviet Union’s rich chess history begins during the Russian Civil War, during which the Bolsheviks used chess as a recruitment and educational tool. Prior to this, chess was reserved as a game for the elites. Alexander Petrov, the first great Russian master was born into a noble family, and the same applies to the many other high profile chess players before the Soviet Union. However, Lenin, an avid chess fan, encouraged chess due to its perception as a game of intellectuals.\n\nAlexander Fyodorovich Ilyin, 1927\nChess in the USSR was kickstarted by Alexander Fyodorovich Ilyin, a strong but relatively unknown player. As a high-ranking officer in the Soviet military, he oversaw the introduction of chess into the Russian military program. After the end of the Russian Civil War, he started the tradition of the Soviet Chess Championship (then called the All-Russian Chess Olympiad). In the first edition of this tournament, future world chess champion Alexander Alekhine won. \nFrom here, chess became a larger part of Soviet politics. Many prominent Bolsheviks were involved in managerial roles for chess, and this furthered the push for stronger chess players in the country.\nPictured: Soviet Chess Propaganda Poster, text reads: “Let us become masters of cultural recreation”,\n1933\nWith this further involvement in chess, multiple tournaments were held, and chess players were allowed to leave the country for international play. Among the players traveling was Mikhail Botvinnik, the first chess world champion under the Soviet Union (Alehkine transferred to the French chess federation before winning his title). \nMikhail Botvinnik, 1962\nA prodigy, he qualified for the USSR championships in 1927 at the age of 16. His first major tournament win (outside of the USSR championships) came with the Leningrad championship (1932), where he scored 10/11, ahead of other strong players such as the aforementioned Ilyin. Botvinnik also won the USSR chess championships in 1931, 1933, and 1939. \nIn the late 1930s and early ‘40s, Soviet chess encountered some turbulence through the wider Soviet political situation. In 1937, the Soviet Union carried out its great purge under Stalin, where political opponents and dissidents were eliminated. However, this also took out members of Soviet chess, such as head of chess and checkers, Nikolai Krylenko. \nIn the late 1930s, the second world war was declared. The USSR was one of the most significant allied forces in this war, but despite this, the game continued. For example, in 1939, 1940, 1944, and 1945, the USSR chess championships still took place, despite the war spanning over all 4 championships, and the last stages of World War II in Europe happening over the 1945 championship.\nAfter WWII continued the Soviet quest to dominate chess, and this came in the form of World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Botvinnik would then go on to lead the Soviet School of Chess, which produced hundreds of chess grandmasters and many world champions. \nThe presence of strong players in the USSR led to them producing the best chess content in the world in the form of many magazines and chess books. This allowed them to export their chess content as propaganda and influence the chess of many countries around the world.\nThe May 1983 edition of 64, a prominent Russian chess magazine\nThe Soviet Union’s Impact on International Chess\nThrough the Soviet Union’s foreign policy during the cold war, chess was proliferated in countries around the world in order to gain favor with politicians and citizens. Three countries with very different economic and political realities, India, Cuba, and the US, had all been influenced by Soviet chess, though not necessarily through governmental interference. \nIndia\nIndia has one of the richest chess histories of any country. The predecessor to international chess, Chaturanga, was invented there. However, international chess was not widespread in India until the 1960s, and rather, regional variants of the game were played with slightly different rules. For example, the pawn double move, and thus en passant, was absent.\nThe introduction of modern chess into India came in the form of Soviet Culture Centers. There were many of these cultural centers around India.\nRussian Center for Science and Culture, Mumbai\nRussian Center for Science and Culture, Delhi\nRussian Center for Science and Culture, Kolkata\nHowever, the most notable of these Cultural Centers (in terms of chess) is the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Chennai. \nThe Soviet Culture Center (now Russian Center of Culture and Science) in Chennai\nThrough the Soviet Union’s Indo-Soviet exchange program, resources were being dedicated to integrate Indians into the Soviet way of life. \nIn 1972, a student of Russian at this center, Manuel Aaron, noticed the presence of chess books in its library. Manuel Aaron was already an established chess player in India at this time: he had already won the Indian National title and the Tamil Nadu State Championship multiple times. Along with this, he was already an International Master, haven gotten his title in 1961. Seeing the presence of high quality resources, Manuel Aaron founded the Tal Chess Club on the 14th of August 1972, around the same time as the Fischer-Spassky match.\nThe Soviets contributed heavily to the success of the Tal Chess Club. They received chess magazines, wooden chess boards, chess clocks; and all for free!\nThe Tal Chess Club wasn’t the only location where the Soviets helped catalyze Indian chess. At the aforementioned Culture Center at Mumbai, Soviet resources were used to teach students from the 70s through to the 90s, but not as many resources were devoted to chess as were in Chennai.\nThe impact of Soviet influence on chess in India. Many might know the story of Vishwanathan (Vishy) Anand. After finding an interest for the game in Manila, he played and studied at the Tal Chess Club, before being the highest rated Indian player of all time, a former world champion, and India’s first grandmaster.\nAnand after winning the World Junior Championship, 1987\nFunnily enough, a 19 year old Anand did play Tal once in a French Blitz tournament, which Anand eventually won. \nThe Tal Chess Club, the powerhouse of early Indian chess, also gave to India more than a world champion. Two of the most notable players who played at the club were RB Ramesh, one of the most successful chess coaches of all time, and Subai Vijayalakshmi, India’s first WGM, though many dozens of strong titled players and prodigies were also present there. \nThrough the Tal Chess Club in Chennai, the Russian House in Mumbai, and providing the environment for Vishy to flourish, Soviet influence has had a heavy influence in chess culture in India. The center was eventually shut down when the Soviet Union collapsed and funding ran dry. \nThe USA\nThe United States was the world’s leading anti-communist power during the Cold War. It is due to this that many might be surprised that the US was heavily influenced by Soviet chess, but this was mainly due to Soviet defectors.\nAs chess became a larger part of Soviet bureaucracy and politics, and as the USSR got more authoritarian under Stalin, chess players felt more pressure to perform and obey. This led to a wave of defectors, especially during the 50s and 60s. Since chess players were allowed to travel internationally, these chess players had greater opportunity to leave the country, and as such, many of them did. \nOne such player was Pal Benko. Benko was a Hungarian player, who started playing tournaments at the late age of 17. He improved rapidly after this though, managing to win the Hungarian championship at 20. Through winning the Hungarian championships, he qualified for the 1952 Interzonal, where the best players from each region would compete. The top 6 players from the Interzonal would then qualify for the Candidates tournament, where they would be joined by the loser of the World Championship and the second place finisher of the previous candidates. \nPal Benko, 1964\nHowever, he wasn’t able to participate. After qualifying for the tournament, but before actually playing in it, he attempted to defect while in West Berlin. He was arrested and placed in a Soviet concentration camp, since Hungary was a Soviet satellite state at that point. Fortunately for Benko, Stalin died a year and a half later, and he was released as a number of other political prisoners were pardoned. \nBenko was still banking on defecting, and about 5 years later, an opportunity reared its head. After the 4th World Student Chess Championships in Reykjavik, Pal Benko headed for the US embassy in Iceland and requested asylum, which he was granted. \n4th World Student Team Championships, 1957\nHe represented Hungary on Board One at this tournament, and led the team to 4th place.\nWhile in the US, Pal Benko had one of the most impressive and influential careers of any American player. He won a record 8 US open chess championships (different from the US Chess Championships), beat four world champions, played at 6 chess olympiads, and was estimated to be the 17th strongest player in the world. \nUS Olympiad Team, 1970, credit: @BertolaGeorges on Twitter\nBenko also played a fundamental role in getting Bobby Fischer to win the World Championship. After qualifying for the famous 1970 Interzonal Tournament, he instead gave up his spot to Fischer, who went on to win the World Championship cycle that year, before becoming a recluse. \nThis story of Pal Benko, possibly the most famous chess defector, is not a one off, and many other players from the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc have defected from the USSR to the US. The US was also special in this sense, since it was fighting the other side of the Cold War, and defectors thus gave it preference. Other defectors have also gone on to have successful chess careers.\nLev Alburt was a Ukrainian who defected in 1979. While in the United States, he became thrice US champion\nRoman Dzindzichashvili, while not a defector, was another player who emigrated to the US from the USSR, and shared the US championship once. \nLubomir Kavelek was a czech chess player, who defected in 1968 after playing a tournament in Poland. He won the US chess championship in 1978.\nOther Soviet Players such as Gata Kamsy, Boris Gulko, Alexander Ivanov, Alex Yermolinsky, Alexander Shabalov, and a few others, left the Soviet Union, either through being allowed emigration or after its collapse, for the US, and all went on to win the US chess championship at one point. \nCuba\nAs a strong ally of the USSR, chess in Cuba was built both through diplomatic relations by the USSR, but also through the influence of Capablanca and Che Guevera.\nCuba has had a rich chess history since western chess has been in the US. There are accounts of Columbus playing chess in Cuba. The first chess “automaton”, the Turk (which was actually a chess master in a box), was invented in Cuba. The first great American chess player, Paul Morphy, played chess in Cuba often.\nCuba’s first top player came in the form of Capablanca, arguably one of the greatest chess players of all time, and a father of modern chess. After Capablanca’s death, the Capablanca memorial was held annually in Cuba, but was scaled up after Che Guevera and Castro overthrew the US backed dictator in Cuba. \nThe Soviet influence in Cuba chess was just encouragement for Guevera to pour money into chess, similarly to the USSR.\nThe first instance of this was with the Capablanca memorial in 1962, where Guevera lavishly funded prizes for the World Class players at the Havana Hilton.\nIn addition, Guevara also looked for hosting the Chess Olympiad in Cuba, with the cooperation of other latin and south american chess players. The olympiad was held in 1966, with teams from the USSR, US, and Hungary finishing top 3. \nWhile the USSR didn’t directly affect Cuban chess that much, the allyship between the USSR and Cuba affected the lives of participants. For example, at many of the aforementioned Capablanca memorials and Olympiads, American players, mainy Bobby Fischer, were not allowed to play due to the fear of Communism by the US state. In addition, as a rather patriotic American, Fischer had issues associating with Cuba, but Guevera’s lively personality held relationships between the two, according to anecdote. \nWhile Cuba was likely the country in the list least influenced by the USSR, as a communist country, it still had a rich chess history, and I felt like it was worth mentioning. \nSoviet Influence After Collapse\nThe Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. However, this doesn’t mean that the culture of chess that existed died with it. 17 of the 38 (47%) chess players rated over 2700 came from countries that were part of the USSR or Eastern Block. In addition, Russia’s effect on World Chess is still large, having hosted multiple chess olympiads and having the current president of FIDE, chess’s governing body.\nWith the growing popularity and democratization of free chess websites like lichess.org or chess.com, it’s unlikely that we will see another country dominating chess like the USSR. However, Soviet games, books, and players have already been solidified in history.\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/blog/soviet-chess-diplomacy/","title":"Soviet Chess Diplomacy"},"https://sudarsh.com/misc/":{"body":"i find joy in listening to music and going on long walks. here are some albums i like a lot that you may like too.\n\nto see the next part of the dream (parannoul)\nin rainbows (radiohead)\ndummy (portishead)\nsoftscars (yeule)\na crow looked at me (mt eerie)\nturning wheel (spelling)\ncome in (weatherday)\n\nmy favorite colors are shades of purple and pink.\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/misc/","title":"Miscellaneous"},"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/":{"body":"This is a lower barrier to entry place for me to put things, where I don’t worry so much about polish.\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/","title":"Notebook"},"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/bandit-brain/":{"body":"This demo trains a deeper stochastic network (no backprop) on a $K$-armed bandit using the neural update rules described earlier:\n\nBias update: For each neuron $v$ with firing indicator $v_f \\in {0,1}$ and EMA firing-rate estimate $\\rho$, update bias as $v_b := v_b - \\Beta(\\rho - v_f)$.\nWeight update: For each edge $(u\\to v)$ that was active during a trajectory, update $w(u,v) := w(u,v) + \\alpha,\\gamma^{d},A_u$ where $A_u$ is an advantage assigned at node $u$ and $d$ is the backward distance discount.\n\nWe interact with a bandit environment with $K$ arms and Bernoulli rewards.

One of the nice things about Caltech is that you can do “reading courses”, where professors can help you on coursework that isn’t officially offered. I would recommend that you also consider this, since there may be a course that you’re interested in that isn’t offered at your university. Unless stated otherwise, all proofs are my own. I will make sure to credit people if I used their proof :)\n(HW 1, Problem 10)\n\nLet $S$ be a nonempty finite set, equipped with an associative operation $*: S \\times S \\to S$ such that, for every $x, y \\in S$, there exists $z\\in S$ such that $x * z = y$, and there exists $z’ \\in S$ (possibly different from $z$) such that $z’ * x = y$. Show that $(S, *)$ is a group.\n\nDefine the function $L_a: S \\to S$ by $L_a(x) = a * x$ for $a \\in S$. $L_a$ is surjective since for all $y \\in S$, there exists $x \\in S$ such that $L_a(x) = y$, by definition. Since $S$ is finite, and a surjective map from a finite set to itself is bijective, $L_a$ is bijective. This allows cancellation:\n$$\na * x = a * y \\implies x = y\n$$\n$$\nx * a = y * a \\implies x = y\n$$\nWe then can show the existence of the identity element. For this, we need to show two things: \n\nthat the identity element works on both the left and right ($ e * x = x * e = x $)\nthat the identity element is unique\n\nWe start by showing that the left and right identity are the same. By definition, there exist $e_1, e_2 \\in S$ such that $e_1 * x = x$ and $x * e_2 = x$ for any $x \\in S$. Then, we take\n$$\nx * e_2 * e_1 * x = x^2\n$$\nBy associativity, we get\n$$\nx * (e_2 * e_1) * x = x^2\n$$\nwhich implies that $x * (e_2 * e_1) = x$ and $(e_2 * e_1) * x$. Thus, the element is a left and right identity. By bijectivity, it is clear that the identity for an element $x$ is unique, so we know that for an element $x$, there exists a unique identity that serves as a left and right identity.\nWe then should show that for $e_x, e_y \\in S$, such that $x * e_x = x$ and $e_y * y = y$, $e_x = e_y$. This is trivial, using the same setup as the previous proof.\nThen, since the operation $*$ maps from $S \\to S$, it is closed by definition, and the existence of an inverse is given. Thus, $(S, *)$ is a group.\n(HW 2, Problem 9)\n\nGiven some prime $p$, let $H \\subset S_p$ be a subgroup of the set of permutations of $p$ elements. Show that if $H$ contains an arbitrary transposition $(ij), i \\neq j$ and the p-cycle $(12\\ldots p)$, then $H = S$. Furthermore, show that this does not hold if $p$ is not prime. \n\nThis proof was helped by Aaron Zhou at Caltech.\nWe first show that $H = S_p$ for prime $p$. WLOG, $j &gt; i$. Then, let $a = j - i$ be the “size” of the transposition. It is clear that any transposition of size $a$ can be achieved by composing one transposition and as many p-cycles as needed. We now aim to show that any transposition can be achieved from a transposition of size $a$ and the cycle.\nMoving an element from index $t$ to index $s$ is very elementary. We can always find some $n$ such that $n \\cdot a \\equiv s - t \\pmod{p}$. Thus, we construct the first part of the operation by applying $n$ transpositions to the element at index $t$ until it is swapped with the element at index $s$. This places the element at index $s$ at index $s - a$. We then apply $n - 1$ transpositions to this element, in the other direction, to place it at index $t$. It can be shown that this constitues a transposition $(ts)$, since the chained transpositions “touch” each element twice, once in each direction. Given all arbitrary transpositions $(ij)$, which we have shown can be achieved from a single specific transposition and a p-cycle, it is simple to show that any permutation can be achieved. \nBased on this, it is simple to show that if $p$ is not prime, then this is not possible. This is because if $a | p$, then you can only move elements to $n \\cdot a \\pmod{p}$, but since $a | p$, this means you can only move elements to indices that are multiples of $a$. Thus, some indices are always inaccessible by this transposition.\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/cool-proofs-from-ma55-md/","title":"Here are some cool proofs from Math 55"},"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/dna-as-prefix-free-strings/":{"body":"We treat DNA as an instruction to synthesis proteins . To formalize this, we can define the program $R$ for ribosome\n$$\nR: {0, 1, 2, 3}^n \\to (p_1, p_2, \\cdots p_m)\n$$\nwhere $p_1, p_2, \\cdots, p_m$ are proteins. \nSince proteins are of variable length, we need to encode a delimiter to seperate proteins from each other. These are equivilant to STOP codons. \nA length-$k$ protein $p$ is equivilant to $A^k$, where $|A| = 20$, which are the number of amino acids we humans. synthesize. This expands causes a vocabulary of $20 + 1 = 21$, including the STOP codon. \nWe bound the number of bases needed per represented amino acid as \n$$\n\\log_4(21) &lt; 2.2\n$$\nIf DNA were perfectly compressed, we should expect around $2.2$ bases per amino for very long proteins. This isn’t the case. Each amino acid is represented by $3$ bases. This is fairly natural for any fixed length encoding scheme. \nHowever, through assigning multiple codons to the most common amino acids, DNA can save on the number of comparisions being done by the ribosome. Take a case where there are 16 possible amino acids $\\in A$, codons of length $s \\geq 2$\nAlso, suppose that $A_0$ was $85$% of all manufactured amino acids, and each remaning element $A_1, \\cdots A_{15}$ each were $1$%. In this case, a map between $A \\to {0, 1, 2, 3}^2$ yields $2$ comparisions per amino acid. \nOn the other hand, a map $F: A \\to {0, 1, 2, 3}^3$ could be much more computationally efficient. Take the output string of this map $S$. Then, if $S_0 = 0$, then $F^{-1}(S) = A_0$.

Net reward also goes up, although this isn’t pictured.\nThis makes sense if $\\phi$ and $\\varphi$ rewarded opposite things, but I don’t think this is the case.\nI think $\\phi$ and $\\varphi$ are orthogonal, and that you can have many different values of $\\varphi$ \nfor a given value of $\\phi$.\nInstead, I have another explanation here. \nLet $u, v$ be vector directions in activation / weight space which roughly represent $\\nabla \\phi$ and $\\nabla \\varphi$ respectively (a direction that maximizes $\\phi, \\varphi$ respectively). Let the model start off with some\nparameter set $\\theta_0$ and represent the model as a function $M$ of $\\theta$, with two components $M_u(\\theta) = \\phi(M(\\theta))$ and $M_v(\\theta) = \\varphi(M(\\theta))$. \nI make the load-bearing claim that the KL divergence required to increase $u$ is larger than the KL divergence required to decrease $u$ and so forth for $v$.

For example, small distributional changes can cause the model to forget a sign when doing math, but making non-trivial gains in math is hard. This leads to the model being less likely to generate things with $+u, +v$ and more likely to generate things with $-u, -v$.

If $\\varphi$ ever gets too low, it becomes very easy to optimize for $\\varphi$ and the expectations work out in favor of $\\varphi$.

When you color the vertices of a graph according to the value of the function at those vertices, the color follows a smooth gradient for low eigenvalues, and the coloring is not smooth for high eigenvalues. \nimport networkx as nx\nimport random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nn = 50  # number of vertices\nd = 6 # degree of each vertex\n\ndef generate_d_regular_graph(n, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a random d-regular graph with n vertices and no self-cycles.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): Number of vertices\n    d (int): Degree of each vertex\n    \n    Returns:\n    nx.Graph: A d-regular graph\n    \"\"\"\n    if n * d % 2 != 0 or d &gt;= n:\n        raise ValueError(\"n * d must be even and d must be less than n\")\n    \n    # Create an empty graph\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    G.add_nodes_from(range(n))\n    \n    # Create a list of available stubs (connection points)\n    stubs = list(range(n)) * d\n    \n    while stubs:\n        # Randomly select two different stubs\n        u, v = random.sample(stubs, 2)\n        \n        # Ensure no self-loops and no multiple edges\n        if u != v and not G.has_edge(u % n, v % n):\n            G.add_edge(u % n, v % n)\n            stubs.remove(u)\n            stubs.remove(v)  \n\n        import sys\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\r\" + \" \" * 20 + \"\\r\")\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\r\" + f\"Number of stubs remaining: {len(stubs)}\")\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n    print()\n    return G\n\ngraph = generate_d_regular_graph(n, d)\nprint(f\"Generated a {d}-regular graph with {n} vertices\")\nprint(f\"Number of edges: {graph.number_of_edges()}\")\n\n# plot the graph\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 9))\npos = nx.spring_layout(graph, k=0.5, iterations=50)\nnx.draw(graph, pos,\n        node_color='lightblue',\n        node_size=300,\n        with_labels=True,\n        font_size=8,\n        edge_color='gray',\n        width=0.6,\n        alpha=0.7)\nplt.title(f'Random {d}-Regular Graph with {n} Vertices', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport networkx as nx\nimport scipy.linalg as sla\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nlaplacian_matrix = nx.laplacian_matrix(graph).toarray()\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(laplacian_matrix)\neigenvectors = eigenvectors.T\n\nvector_nums = [1, 15]\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(24, 9))\n\nfor i, vector_num in enumerate(vector_nums):\n    curr_vector = eigenvectors[vector_num]\n    \n    # plot the graph, and color the vertices by the values in the eigenvector\n    nx.draw(graph, ax=axs[i], node_color=curr_vector, cmap='viridis', node_size=300, \n            with_labels=True, font_size=8, edge_color='gray', width=0.6, alpha=0.7)\n    axs[i].set_title(f'Graph Colored by Eigenvector {vector_num + 1}')\n    axs[i].axis('off')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\nWe can first try to show something like this for the continuous case. Start by defining the laplacian operator \n$$\nL = \\frac{\\partial F^2}{\\partial^2 x}\n$$\nWe want to find some eigenfunction, which is a function $f$ such that \n$$\nLf = \\lambda f\n$$\nfor some eigenvalue $\\lambda$. \nWe can show that the only functions that satisfy this are of the form $f(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$. It is trivial to verify this, and it’s a little more involved to prove this (but it is true!)\nAs a result, for some function $F(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$, we have that that $F’’(x) = -k^2 A \\sin(kx) - k^2 B \\cos(kx) = -k^2 F(x)$. Thus, for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$, we know that it corresponds to a component with frequency $k = \\sqrt{-\\lambda}$. A result from the theory of Fourier analysis is that you can decompose any function into a sum of sines and cosines and that the eigenvectors of the laplacian are the components of the function. \nWe can fall on the limit definition of the Laplacian, which says that \n$$\nLf = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) + f(x-h) - 2f(x)}{h^2}\n$$\nIf we instead say that our value of $h$ is a discrete value, we get a definition of the Laplacian for a grid that has $n$ dimensions.\n$$\nLf(v) = \\sum_{i \\in [n]} \\frac{f(v + x_i) + f(v - x_i) - 2f(v)}{||x_i||^2}\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ is the “step” vector in the $i$th dimension. It is fairly easy to see that as $||x_i|| \\to 0$, the definition of the Laplacian converges to the definition of the Laplacian operator. Furthermore, this is equivilant to increasing the number of points in the grid, while keeping $||x_i|| = 1$\nWe now can pair up adjacent vertices of the graph with edges, setting lattice points to vertices and the connections to edges. We then want to show that the Laplacian converges to the Laplacian operator, for some function $F: V \\to \\mathbb{R}$, which is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. \nWe start with two defintions of the Laplacian, and aim to show that they are the same.\n$$\nLf = Df - Af\n$$\n$$\nLf = \\sum_{u \\sim v} \\frac{f(v) - f(u)}\n$$\nwhere $u\\simv$ denotes all $u$ such that there is an edge between $u$ and $v$. Since the number of edges connecting to a vertex is equal to the degree of the vertex, we can say that \n$$\nLf = \\sum_{u \\sim v} \\frac{f(v) - f(u)} = d f(v) - \\sum_{u \\sim v} f(u)\n$$\n$$\n= Df - \\sum_{u \\sim v} f(u)\n$$\n$$\n= Df - Af\n$$\nWe can then partition $U = {u \\sim v}$ into two sets of equal size $U’$ and $U’’$. We can then rephrase the operator $Lf$ as \n$$\nLf = \\sum_{i \\in [\\frac{|U|}{2}]} f(u_i’) + f(u_i’’) - 2f(v)\n$$\nThis is now the same as the discrete grid Laplacian, which is equivilant to the definition of the Laplacian operator in the limit as the grid size goes to infinity.\nHowever, note that this works on only specific constructions of the graph $G$, while the actual result emperically works for many other graphs. While talking with a friend at Caltech, we realized that this was in part related to the how the graph drawing software NetworkX chooses to draw graphs. Namely, plotting the index vs the value of the eigenvector at the index does not result in a smooth gradient for any eigenvalue. \n\nThe graph drawing algorithm solves the spring problem, which does the following:\n\nTreat each edge $e$ as a spring, with equilibrium length $l$, spring constant $k$, and current length $x_e$. Both of these values are equal for all edges.\nCompute the total potential energy of the system, $PE =\\sum_{e \\in E} \\frac12 k (x_e - l)^2$\nMinimize $PE$, which is done through iteratively applying Hooke’s law, $F = -k x_e$.\n\nThis smoothness breaks for large graphs, but I think that this is much more because the loss landscape is uglier for large graphs and thus the optimal graph cannot be achieved, and not because the optimal graph does not show smoothness. I still haven’t truly solved this, haha.\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/spectral-graph-theory/","title":"Eigenvectors of the Graph Laplacian hold Spectral Information"},"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/squirrel/":{"body":"Squirrel\n\n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/squirrel/","title":"Squirrel"},"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/two-model-secret-keeping/":{"body":"Maybe?

In a few thousand days after that, these systems may be better than all humans. These systems, artifical general intelligences (AGIs) may have unprecedented variance in outcomes, providing huge, novel utility, or causing significant amounts of suffering, even in the case of aligned AGIs. This presents a new era of human computer interfaces, one where the machine may be able to infer your intents, and operate to, or against your intents, better than any system prior. With cheap, abundant superintelligence, what should technology look like?\n1. Flourishing\nIn an ideal world, all technological progress pushes towards the north star of abundance and human flourishing. Many AGI dreams are sold on the backbone of this promise of flourishing - new drugs that prevent cancer, automation of sluggish work, new forms of math and physics. This is good, and the future of easy valence should be brought closer by the advent of superintelligence.\nThe unwavering march of technology has put innovation first and flourshing second, and despite this it has generally always worked out in favor of human flourishing. Unarguably, the world today is materially and politically better than almost any time before it, and this is due to technology. Never before have the luxuries of the wealthy been so equitably distributed. The median American is wealthy, owns their own home, and has an PPP adjusted income that would have been upper class fifty years ago.\nHowever, we should consider ourselves lucky for this. Humanity is no stranger to technology that has hurt it. Leaded gasoline, nuclear bombs, gain-of-function research, CFCs, are all examples of this.\nIf all goes well, the dividends of superintelligence look like that of most positive innovations, except multiplied many orders of magnitude. However, even in the case of aligned superintelligence, I don’t think this is guaranteed. Conditional on alignment, which I agree is a very significant condition, the largest risk that is posed by cheap general intelligence is one of gradual disempoverment. The Intelligence Curse by Luke and Rudolph does a better treatment of this than I could, so I encourage you to read it. In this scenario, AGI labs consolidate power and push most people out of the way.\nAfter superintelligence, most of human work will be automated, likely to whoever has the most intelligent model, and humanity will need to find purpose in another way. Yet, even with this overhaul, I think that there is an opportunity for human-machine synergy that presents itself even today, where technology can be the dirving force for personal flourishing.\nIn the dramatic retelling of this story, I would argue that the divide between unlimited abundane and significant suffering was build this human machine synergy. Unfortunately, good outcomes are not that simple, and the most ofthis fight will be one of governance and politics. Instead, I argue that while we should be wary of bad worlds, some of us should also work towards a better interface with superintelligence, both as an illustration of what a good world looks like, and to improve the flourishing of many today.\nI like to refer to my vision for this better interface as the village elder.\n2. Caring About the Person\nConsider at a person in the near future. They have their own set of goals, both instrumental and intrinsic. Their goals are diverse, inconsistent, and change over time. Their goals are both explicit and implicit. A system that maximizes goals indiscriminately has a hard time here, and requires some inductive biases about how humans approach their goals. The paperclipping example is a good one here. If the model knew anything about humans, it would know that paperclipping is not what the person meant, and this is the world that we want to get to.\nIn a way, the persona that we should cultivate in interactions is that the model cares about the user as a person, and not just as a tool for the company deploying it. This is a much harder alignment task, and solving this is approximately as hard as solving alignment.\nWe can build up towards a simpler version of this by looking at what our wants for how a caring model acts imply, and use these inductive biases to inform how to build out this model.\nFirstly, the model should not be our friend. We should treat AI friends as \n","id":"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/village-elder-2/","title":"The Village Elder"},"https://sudarsh.com/notebook/village-elder/":{"body":"\nAI has been a new form of Human Computer Interaction for me.

They provide a small, positive impact to your day,\nand help you get things done. In the ideal world, having the technology doesn’t\nstifle your ability to get out of bed, leave the house, meet people, or date. \nHaving technology should help you get these things done.

The\nelder checks your social media if you’d like it to, and kicks you off social \nmedia if you’re spiraling on a doomscroll.\nThe elder replaces almost all of your other technology. The future is simple,\nwith text editors, browsers, and minimal Linux interfaces to reduce technology\nto the coolest tool we have.

This small number of neurons makes it an ideal model organism to study brains.
